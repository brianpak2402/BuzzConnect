# BuzzConnect API

## Usage
1. Run the following command from the root of this project. 
```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
``` 
This will present a collection of messages on the screen. Ignore these messages and wait until you receive the message: `Started BuzzConnectApplication ...`
2. While this service is running, feel free to invoke any API calls from another instance of the command-line. The following is an example API call:
```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/buzzconnect/event/all
```
If a certain API call requests parameters, you will need to precede each input with a `-d` flag as follows:
```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/buzzconnect/host/login -d username=gburdell2022 -d password=gojackets!
```
